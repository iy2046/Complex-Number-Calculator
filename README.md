# Complex-Number-Calculator
This C++ Complex Number Calculator enables users to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of complex numbers. It also calculates the conjugate of a complex number. 

The calculator is designed using two main classes: Complex for number operations and Handler for managing user interaction. The program allows users to input complex numbers in a natural format, handles edge cases such as negative imaginary parts, and outputs results in an easy-to-read format. The implementation emphasizes efficiency, modularity, and ease of use, making it a practical tool for complex number computations.
